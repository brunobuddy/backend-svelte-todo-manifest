# Demo TODO App fullstack: Svelte + Manifest ðŸ§¡ðŸ¦š

This repository showcases a demo of a small **todo application** combining [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as a frontend and [Manifest](https://manifest.build) as backend.

The backend consists in only a few lines of code:

```yaml
name: My TODO App âœ…
entities:
  Todo:
    seedCount: 10
    properties:
      - title
      - { name: completed, type: boolean }
```


## Install

```bash
npm install

# Launch backend
npm run manifest

# Launch frontend
npm run dev
```
